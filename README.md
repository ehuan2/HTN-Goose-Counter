# HTN-Goose-Counter
Hi! This is the public repository for our upcoming Hack the North workshop focused on Docker. Lets have fun!

## Deploying the app:
***Step (1)***:
- Create a GCP Project.

***Step (2)***:
- Enable Billing.

***Step (3)***:
- Go to Compute Engine and create a new instance.
- Select Boot Disk as ****Container Optimized OS****
- Then click allow HTTP traffic under firewall

***Step (4)***:
- Click on VPC Network, then go to Firewall
- Create a new rule:
    - Give it a name
    - Switch targets to all instances in network
    - Then in IP ranges add in ```0.0.0.0/0``` for all traffic
    - Under protocols and ports allow all

***Step (5)***:
- Connect to the VM by clicking on that SSH button

***Step (6)***:
- Clone the git repo: https://github.com/ehuan2/HTN-Goose-Counter.git (make sure this is the full solution branch)
```git clone https://github.com/ehuan2/HTN-Goose-Counter.git```

***Step (7)***:
- ```cd``` into ```HTN-Goose-Counter```: ```cd HTN-Goose-Counter``` and then edit ```/src/frontend/public/main.html``` and replace the ```localhost``` with the ```external IPs``` from your cloud service provider.

***Step (8)***:
- Run the actual application by building each one according to the Makefile. Then run the following for docker-compose up:
```
docker run --rm \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v "$PWD:$PWD" \
    -w="$PWD" \
    docker/compose:1.24.0 up
```
